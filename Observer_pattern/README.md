# 🧱 Breakout Game – Observer Pattern

A Java-based implementation of the classic Breakout game using the **Observer Design Pattern** for modular and responsive game behavior.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Classic Breakout gameplay: paddle, bricks, and bouncing ball
- Observer Pattern used for event handling between game entities
- Clean object-oriented design in Java

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Java
- **Design Pattern**: Observer Pattern
- **Platform**: Desktop

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Ball.java`, `Brick.java`, `Paddle.java`, `Game.java`, etc. – Core game components
- `Observer.java`, `Subject.java` – Interfaces for the observer pattern
- `GamePanel.java` – Main game logic and rendering

## 🚀 Running the Game

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AAZINSHAIKH/Breakout_game.git
cd Breakout_game/Observer_pattern
```

2. Compile the code:

```bash
javac *.java
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
java Game
```

## 🎓 Educational Focus

This project demonstrates practical use of the **Observer Pattern** in a real-time game scenario, making it a great reference for design pattern assignments or Java OOP learning.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

Implementations of the Breakout game using other Object-Oriented Design Patterns (e.g., Strategy, Singleton, Factory) are currently **Work In Progress** and will be added to this repository soon.
